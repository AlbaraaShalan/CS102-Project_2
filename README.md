CS102 project
This Java project was created to oversee the operations of a network of grocery stores by developing a 
Java-based Point-of-Sale (POS) system. The POS system enables customers to make purchases from the store, 
concurrently monitoring inventory levels and generating comprehensive sales reports. This program simulates a 
basic retail management system with functionalities for managing products, inventory, and customer sales. The main 
functionality is divided into operations for a store manager and operations for a customer, with user interactions facilitated through a command-line interface.


The product class: 
In practical applications, a collection of Product objects would be managed, allowing for operations such as adding new products,
updating prices, adjusting inventory levels, and calculating discounts based on defined business logic.

The cart class:
This Java code defines a Cart class representing a shopping cart for a retail system. The shopping cart is designed to hold CartItem objects,
each associated with a Product and a quantity.

The CartItem class:
This class represents an item in a shopping cart and encapsulates information about a specific product and the quantity of that product in the cart.

The Discountable interface:
We created this for items that can provide a discount and also that defines a method to calculate the discount on a product. 

The Sale class:
This class represents a sale transaction, including details about the customer, the items in the shopping cart (Cart), and the total amount. 

The report class:
In this class  it Represents a sales report with a list of sales, a total amount, and a list of popular products. We then construct a new Report with an empty list of sales,
total set to 0, and an empty list of popular products. Then we create a method to display the sales report including the total sale amount and details of popular products.
